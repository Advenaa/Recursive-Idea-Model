# The Recursive Idea Model (RIM)

A framework for challenging, decomposing, and synthesizing ideas through continual learning AI systems and agent swarm orchestration.

## Overview

RIM proposes an AI system that recursively decomposes, challenges, and synthesizes ideas — combining depth-first recursive analysis with breadth-first parallel orchestration. The framework draws on five key developments in AI research:

- **DSPy** (Stanford NLP) — Declarative AI programming and automatic optimization
- **Recursive Language Models** (Zhang et al.) — Managing unbounded analytical context
- **AOrchestra** (Ruan et al.) — Dynamic sub-agent creation
- **Kimi K2.5 Agent Swarm & PARL** (Moonshot AI) — Parallel agent orchestration via reinforcement learning
- **Continual Learning** (Bhalla, 2026) — Memory systems and feedback loops for persistent improvement

## Core Architecture

RIM consists of six layers working in recursive feedback loops:

1. **Decomposition** — Recursive engine breaking ideas into sub-components and assumptions
2. **Challenge** — Adversarial critique stress-testing each component
3. **Synthesis** — Integration engine rebuilding stronger ideas from critique results
4. **Orchestration** — Parallel agent swarm coordinating breadth at each recursive level
5. **Specialization** — Dynamic agent spawner creating domain-targeted analysts
6. **Learning** — Memory system + feedback loops for cross-session improvement

## Key Insight

> Neither depth nor breadth alone is sufficient. Depth without parallelism is slow and bottlenecked; parallelism without depth is broad but shallow. RIM combines both.
